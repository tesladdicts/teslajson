# [testatus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/testatus)

Python suite to: 1) Access Tesla vehicle status via APIs, 2) Poll and log Tesla vehicle status via API, 3) Parse vehicle logs, and 4) Perform some limited indirect RPCs to change Tesla vehicle status

Tesla vehicle status API written by Greg Glockner, poller/rpc written by Seth Robertson, database reports by Pedro Mendes

## API Description
This is a simple Python interface to the [Tesla JSON
API](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/). With this, you can query your
vehicle, control charge settings, turn on the air conditioning, and
more.  You can also embed this into other programs to automate these
controls.

The class is designed to be simple.  You initialize a _Connection_
object, retrieve the list of _Vehicle_ objects, then perform get/set
methods on a _Vehicle_.  There is a single get method
[_Vehicle.data\_request()_] and a single set method [_Vehicle.command()_] so
that the class does not require changes when there are minor updates
to the underlying JSON API.

This has been tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.5.  It has no dependencies
beyond the standard Python libraries.

### Installation
0. Download the repository zip file and uncompress it
0. Run the following command with your Python interpreter: `python setup.py install`


### Public API
`Connection(email, password, **kwargs)`:
Initialize the connection to the Tesla Motors website.

Required parameters:

- Option one:

  - _email_: your login for teslamotors.com
  - _password_: your password for teslamotors.com

- Option two: (May be combined with option one)

  - _tokens\_file_: A file containing json token authentication data as tesla generates.  Updated when expires.

- Option three:

  - _access\_token_: An active access token for your account.  May expire.


Optional parameters:

- _proxy\_url_: URL for proxy server
- _proxy\_user_: username for proxy server
- _proxy\_password_: password for proxy server
- _retries_: number of times to retry request before failing
- _retry\_delay_: multiplicative backoff on failure
- _tesla\_client_: Override API retrevial from pastebin
- _debug_: Activate HTTP debugging
- _json_: Return result in parsable JSON format


`Connection.vehicles`: A list of Vehicle objects, corresponding to the
vehicles associated with your account on teslamotors.com.

`Vehicle`: The vehicle class is a subclass of a Python dictionary
(_dict_).  A _Vehicle_ object contains fields that identify your
vehicle, such as the Vehicle Identification Number (_Vehicle['vin']_).
All standard dictionary methods are supported.

`Vehicle.wake_up()`: Wake the vehicle.

`Vehicle.data_all()`: Retrieve all data values associated with vehicle.

`Vehicle.data_request(name)`: Retrieve data values specified by _name_, such
as _charge\_state_, _climate\_state_, _vehicle\_state_. Returns a
dictionary (_dict_).  For a full list of _name_ values, see the _GET_
commands in the [Tesla JSON API](http://docs.timdorr.apiary.io/).

`Vehicle.command(name)`: Execute the command specified by _name_, such
as _charge\_port\_door\_open_, _charge\_max\_range_. Returns a
dictionary (_dict_).  For a full list of  _name_ values, see the _POST_ commands
in the [Tesla JSON API](http://docs.timdorr.apiary.io/).

### Example
	import teslajson
	c = teslajson.Connection('youremail', 'yourpassword')
	v = c.vehicles[0]
	v.wake_up()
	v.data_request('charge_state')
	v.command('charge_start')

### Partial example:

	c = teslajson.Connection(access_token='b5bb9d8014a0f9b1d61e21e796d78dccdf1352f23cd32812f4850b878ae4944c', tesla_client='{"v1": {"id": "e4a9949fcfa04068f59abb5a658f2bac0a3428e4652315490b659d5ab3f35a9e", "secret": "c75f14bbadc8bee3a7594412c31416f8300256d7668ea7e6e7f06727bfb9d220", "baseurl": "https://owner-api.teslamotors.com", "api": "/api/1/"}}')

## tesla_poller

Written by Seth Robertson

### Description

Use the teslajson library to do smart polling of your Tesla(s) and log
the resulting JSON information to a directory for
post-processing. Monitor different things with different frequency
depending on what you are doing (e.g. driving, charging, pre-heating,
nothing, etc).

Also support an insecure network API (so only allow local connections
to use it!) with `--command 127.0.0.1:60001` (or some other local
address:port combination to bind to) to allow specific commands to be
executed on your behalf.  Currently only "quit" and "autocondition"
are supported.  Autocondition requests additional change and turns on
car climate control, to (e.g.) charge/heat the battery and get the
interior heat/cooled as needed, soon before leaving. After leaving, it
resets the desired battery charge back to normal.

Command line arguments are requried for authentication: `--token`,
`--tokenfile`, or `--email` and `--password`.

In order to log the data, supply an output directory with `--outdir
path`.  In addition to a file named by YEAR-MON-DAY.json, there is a
symlink cur.json to the most recent file.

You may override the intervals of important (polling frequency mostly)
by using `--intervals inactive=61` or similar.

#$# Reading the stored data

`tesla-parser.py` was created to read the stored data.

Example usage: `tesla-parser.py /path/to/cur.json`

By default it provides summary information for drives you make,
charges you do, and standby times.

If you want to see more detailed information, use `-v`.  Add another
`-v` or two to learn about even less important activity.

You may supply multiple files, and you may use the `-f` argument to
follow a file as it is appended to.  A convenient way to dump all
historical information and then start printing any future information
is:

`tesla-parser.py -f /var/logs/tesla/cur.json -n 0 /var/logs/tesla/20*.json`

Example output:

    2018-07-07 08:50:56 +0:20:04 Drove   20.58M at cost of 10% 25.4M at  80.9% efficiency
    2018-07-07 09:16:00 +4:55:03 Sat&Lost  2%  15.8M or  77.2M/d
    2018-07-07 14:11:03 +0:22:08 Drove   20.33M at cost of  8% 20.2M at 100.4% efficiency
    2018-07-07 14:38:11 +0:12:12 Sat&Lost  0%   0.0M or   0.0M/d
    2018-07-07 14:50:23 +2:32:50 Charged  25% (to  88%) 19.37kW  79.1M ( 31mph, 77.5kW 311.8M max)

In the above example, the vehicle started on a 20 mile trip at 8:50
am, which took 20 minutes.  It actually use 25 rated miles of range
(10% of battery), meaning 81% efficiency.

The vehicle then sat for 5 hours and lost 2% of charge (16 rated
miles) for a 77 miles per day effective rate (perhaps cabin
temperature control was enabled).

There was a 22 minute return trip, this time at 100% efficiency. The
vehicle sat for 12 minutes (not losing any power), and then was
charged for 2.5 hours, to 88%, getting 19kW or 79 rated miles.  The
charge was obtained at an average speed of 31mph, and implied a
fully charged battery size of 78kW and a 312 maximum rated mile range.

### Storing the data in a relational database

`tesla-parser.py` is able to insert the stored data into a relational
database which may be more convenient for analysis. In order to do this
an adequate Postgresql database needs to be installed and accessible.
Create a database named "tesladata" and set a user (eg. "teslauser")
with privileges to create tables. Then run the file `create_tables`
with this user. Set the connection details in the file `dbconfig`,
including the password for the user (it is advisible to have that file
protected from other users so as not to reveal the password).

`create user teslauser with encrypted password 'example';`
`create database tesladata encoding 'UTF8' lc_collate='en_US.UTF-8' lc_ctype='en_US.UTF-8' template template0;`
`grant all privileges on database tesladata to teslauser;`
`psql -U testauser testladata < create_tables.sql`

To store the data into the database run `tesla-parser.py` with the
command line option `--dbconfig dbconfig`. Instead of dumping
summary statistics this will instead insert the data into
the database. Make sure to indicate the file(s) with the data desired.
For example:

`tesla-parser.py -n 0 --dbconfig dbconfig /var/logs/tesla/20*.json`

If the data had already been inserted into the database in a previous
run, the program will issue appropriate warnings.

### Using the remote control

The `poller_rpc.py` program implements a client side of the RPC.  It
is pretty primitive.  Specify the remote address of the server with
`--cmd_address 127.0.0.1:60001` or similar matching addressing.  Then
you use --variables to specify commands.  Example:

        # Ask server to quit
        ./poller_rpc.py --cmd_address 127.0.0.1:60001 --variables cmd=quit
        # Do default autoconditioning
        ./poller_rpc.py --cmd_address 127.0.0.1:60001 --variables cmd=autocondition
        # Set battery charge limit to 77%, do NOT do cabin preconditioning
        ./poller_rpc.py --cmd_address 127.0.0.1:60001 --variables cmd=autocondition --variables level=77 --variables temp=
        # Set battery charge limit to 90%, reset limit to 77% when next driving, precondition cabin to 80°
        ./poller_rpc.py --cmd_address 127.0.0.1:60001 --variables cmd=autocondition --variables level=90 --variables autoresetlimit=77 --variables temp=80


### Bugs

Only tested with one vehicle.
